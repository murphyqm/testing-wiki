2. Either upload a markdown file, or create and edit one in browser. You can paste in images.

3. Add a file title. You can add it to a folder/create a new folder path here too by typing in `folder_name/file_name.md`. GitHub will automatically parse this. Ensure you give your file an `.md` file ending. We can decide on naming conventions.

4. You can hit "Commit changes" when you want to save, and will be prompted with this dialogue to create a new branch. You can commit the changes to the branch (by clicking "Propose changes") and come back to modify it later.

5. This will open the pull request dialogue. You can leave this page if you want to make more changes, or can select "Create pull request". Once a pull request is created, GitHub actions will automatically run a test to see that the website will compile.
