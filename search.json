You can paste in images. \nAdd a file title. You can add it to a folder/create a new folder path here too by typing in folder_name/file_name.md. GitHub will automatically parse this. Ensure you give your file an .md file ending. We can decide on naming conventions. \nYou can hit “Commit changes” when you want to save, and will be prompted with this dialogue to create a new branch. You can commit the changes to the branch (by clicking “Propose changes”) and come back to modify it later. \nThis will open the pull request dialogue. You can leave this page if you want to make more changes, or can select “Create pull request”. Once a pull request is created, GitHub actions will automatically run a test to see that the website will compile. \nYou can see if your additions built correct, and merge the pull request. \n\nAll you need to do is visit the GH repo and add a file in the appropriate folder. You can also create a subfolder if needed (to create hierarchical categories).\nYou will be prompted to create a new branch to store your addition. You can wait until you’re happy with your addition before merging it back into the main branch. The site will then render and update to include your addition.\nIf you want to see the rendered output of a work in progress, you can always put it in the “misc” folder and then run the workflow manually to check it looks correct, or simply add WIP (for work in progress) to the title.\nEach page of the rendered site also has a link to the repo location.\nYou can also see the authors/contributors of any specific article by clicking the “view source” link to the right.\n\n\n\nIf your article/note is relevant to a certain area or field, but does not contain terms that someone might search for, consider adding in a list of keywords or themes somewhere in the body of the article so it will be picked up by the search function."
